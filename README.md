## Purpose ##

This is a project build on the freedomGPT opensource AI.
The goal is to enable the model establish communication 
with the SnrokL which implements tools to protect a 
vulnerable project without modifying the built project.
the chatbot will be trained to carryout some security
assessments and defense will be implemented by NixLynGPT.
Just the nutshell decription as there is more to come...

## FirstStep ##

In order to be able to follow along with this 
implementation, you will need to have a basic understanding
of Python Object-Orientated-Programming and shell scripting.
If you do not have this covered, I suggest go to 
<a href="github.com/NixLyn/Basics/">
Basics</a> repo to understand how we are making use 
of functions outside of the main script
